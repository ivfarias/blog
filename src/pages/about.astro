    <p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>
    <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
      <li>I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.</li>
      {identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && 
        <li>My main hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
      } 
    </ul>
    <p>Things I'm good at:</p>
    <ul>
      {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill.good}</li>)}
    </ul>
    <p>Things I'm okay at (but working on getting better):</p>
    <ul>
      {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill.okay}</li>)}
    </ul>
    <p>Things I'm not good at:</p>
    <ul>
      {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill.bad}</li>)}
    </ul>
